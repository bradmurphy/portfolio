<p>I always find writing about myself to be a rather difficult task.  However -- this is my portfolio, so I suppose I should say a few things.</p>

<p>I currently reside in Ann Arbor, Michigan and work for <a href="http://www.byhook.com" target="_blank" class="hook">Hook</a> with an amazing group of extremely talented people.</p>

<p>Aside from programming, I tend to spend my time either playing a never ending list of video game titles or hanging out with my dog, Atlas.  When we're not walking the city, you can usually find us grabbing some good eats or crashed out on the couch watching a good film.  And of course, last but not least -- jamming out to some good tunes!</p>

<p>This is where I keep select digital creations that I find fun, unique or interesting.  Feel free to explore at your leisure.</p>
