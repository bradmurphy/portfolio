<h1>about</h1>

<p>I always find writing about yourself to be a rather difficult task.  Though, this is my portfolio, so I suppose I can say a few things.</p>

<p>I live in Ann Arbor, Michigan and work at <a href="http://www.byhook.com" target="_blank" class="hook">Hook</a> with an amazing group of extremely talented people.  This is where I keep select digital creations that I find fun, unique or interesting.  Feel free to look around at your leisure.</p>

<p>Aside from coding, I tend to spend my time either playing a never ending list of video game titles or hanging out with my dog, Atlas.  When we're not walking the city, you can usually find us grabbing some good eats or crashed out on the couch watching a good film.  And of course, last but not least - jamming out to some good tunes!</p>
