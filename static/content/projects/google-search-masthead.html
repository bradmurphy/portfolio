<p>After learning lessons from a previous build of mastheads, we switched over to the YouTube API.  Not only did it give us greater freedom, it allowed us to have a lot more functionality with the interactions of the YouTube player.  The biggest challenge of this banner was timing the animation video with the HTML animation.  It was also a bit tricky to maintain the aspect ratio on the video transition.</p>

<p>All in all, this came out to be an extremely smooth and delightful banner.</p>
