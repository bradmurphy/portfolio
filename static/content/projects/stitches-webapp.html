<p>Stitches is a sprite sheet generator for the modern web.  It can compile to Stylus, CSS and SCSS as well as adjust padding, class names and layout style.  This was the first major internal project my team was a part of and I have to say that it came out fantastic.  After doing a solid pass through functionality, we were able to get some great design assets to really make the app stand out.</p>

<p>A great tool for any developer in need of a quick spritesheet!</p>
