<p>This is the first YouTube domain site we have worked on.  This one was really a joy to work on since our experience and ability with Polymer has definitely risen up a few levels.  About 80% of the site is wrapped in one singular element, which made the grid extremely easy to manipulate.  We did find that some of the custom polymer elements were not working as intended.</p>

<p>As with all projects, they all have their hiccup - this one was no different.  We were able to find solutions outside of the Polymer elements to do what we needed, but it would of been much easier had they just played nicely.  That said, everything else seemed to be a breeze, especially cross browser compatibility.</p>
