<p>“We’re taking a once complacent brand and making it current. By giving people the choice to customize their chocolate box to their personal tastes, Russell Stover is no longer a blast from the past.”</p>

<p>In my final quarter at the Creative Circus, I had the pleasure of working on this ambitious project. We were tasked with rebranding a failing brand. We fell on Russell Stover Chocolate. Included is a complete slide presentation along with a full responsive website with all front-end functionality in place. I was also able to build a small Angular Web App which is the micro-site you will find within the presentation.</p>
