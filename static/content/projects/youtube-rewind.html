<p>Rewind to the Future is part of the #YoutubeRewind campaign.  This site was released as an easter egg that could be accessed from clicking on the correct annotation from the campaign video.  It features random mashups of different YouTube content creators, enabling the user to get a different permuatation each time they "Rewind".</p>

<p>The challenge of the project was the complete loading of dynamic data on every refresh, making sure all assets, copy and the general layout was responsive and delightful throughout the experience.  Built using the Polymer framework, we were able to craft an experience that is not only really fun and exciting, but also something we're extremely proud to be a part of.</p>
