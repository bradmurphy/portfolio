<p>Terra Bella was by far one of the longest projects I've been apart of.  We went through many designs and revisions, implementing the Angular framework.  I would say the most difficult challenge stemming from this project was having to learn Angular as we were developing.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, this project helped me grow more than most and ending up with a very elegant experience is always a joy.</p>
